# heySiri
Say "hey Siri" and your mac will start listening to you and you can give voice commands for iTunes. Later I will add google searches and functionality to play songs by their name.  
Here are the things you can say so far:  

-play  
-pause
-up                       (volume up)  
-down                     (volume down)  
-volume #                 (volume at a certain number out of 100)  
-next                     (next song)  
-previous                 (previous song)  
-what song is this?
